I am a PhD candidate in statistics at UC Davis, working with [Prof. Hans-Georg MÃ¼ller](https://anson.ucdavis.edu/~mueller/). My research involves developing time warping models for multivariate functional data.

I am also an experienced statistical consultant and communicator. I have collaborated on applied projects from a wide variety of domains, ranging from veterinary science to mountaineering to neuroimaging.
